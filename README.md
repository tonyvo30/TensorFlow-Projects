# Tensor Flow Projects

These projects were for me to learn and utilize TensorFlow to do generic machine learning tasks.

Different tasks/subjects are in different Jupyter notebooks, and each notebook have different dependencies. I used a virtual environment for these notebooks.

## Tasks/subjects

- Neural Networks
- Linear Regression
- Clustering
- Classification

## To Do

- NLP with RNN
- Reinforcement learning with Q-Learning
