    "# Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering is a Machine Learning technique that involves the grouping of data points. In theory, data points that are in the same group should have similar properties and/or features, while data points in different groups should have highly dissimilar properties and/or features.\n",

    "## Basic Algorithm for K-Means.\n",
    "- Step 1: Randomly pick K points to place K centroids\n",
    "- Step 2: Assign all the data points to the centroids by distance. The closest centroid to a point is the one it is assigned to.\n",
    "- Step 3: Average all the points belonging to each centroid to find the middle of those clusters (center of mass). Place the corresponding centroids into that position.\n",
    "- Step 4: Reassign every point once again to the closest centroid.\n",
    "- Step 5: Repeat steps 3-4 until no point changes which centroid it belongs to.\n",

    "## Hidden Markov Models\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The Hidden Markov Model is a finite set of states, each of which is associated with a (generally multidimensional) probability distribution []. Transitions among the states are governed by a set of probabilities called transition probabilities.\" (http://jedlik.phy.bme.hu/~gerjanos/HMM/node4.html)\n",

    "A hidden markov model works with probabilities to predict future events or states. In this section we will learn how to create a hidden markov model that can predict the weather."
